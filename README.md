# The Jungle
Welcome!

## Intro ##
The Jungle is a working copy of my experiments in game engine design, experimental artificial intelligence, procedural world generation, and various other wide-ranging game engine and design concepts I will be testing throughout the lifetime of this code. It's programmed in JavaScript and the graphics system used is HTML5 Canvas for the time being. Everything is currently single-threaded, but webworkers will probably be used at some point in the future once requirements begin to rise. 

## Files ##
The project contains very few files: the main html file, which is simply a frame for the canvas element and the calls to the .js files; the app.js file, which holds all of my own code; and the Sublime Text 3 project file. The perlin.js file is not written by me, but was shared by the generosity of a few programmers I've never met before; credit to them is given at the bottom of this readme.
